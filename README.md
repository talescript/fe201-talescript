Now you can directly work in your browser!

## Getting started

### HTML

If you want to visualize the **index.html** file on the browser:

- please click on the **Show Preview** button that's next to the file name in the tab bar.

This will automatically open a mini browser inside your editor and will show you live any updates that you make on the file.

### CSS

To style to your **index.html**, you can start using:

- the **styles.css** file located under the **_stylesheets_** folder, it's already linked with the **_index.html_** and add your own custom styles
- or if you prefer you can use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/), it's also already linked with the **_index.html_**
<p></p>

### JS

There is an **index.js** file located under the **js** folder, it's already linked with the **_index.html_**

_Now that we are ready, let's have some coding fun!_
